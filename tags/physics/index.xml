      <description>Motivation:
 General Relativity Inertia Tensor Stress Tensor  It took me a whole week figure out what a tensor actually is. You will find many definitions and some are only partially correct. Let&amp;rsquo;s walk through the different explanations and learn how to think about them.
 (Array Definition) Tensor = Multi-dimensional array of numbers (scalars (rank 0), vectors (rank 1), matricies (rank 2), etc.). This is true in a sense but there is a truer geometrical meaning behind the concept of a tensor.</description>

      <description>Generalized Coordinates and Conservation Laws From the Lagrangian Formulation of Theoretical Mechanics These are selected notes from a group of topics I find of particular interest. Although I assume some previous knowledge of classical mechanics from you, I still provide a brief overview of what the Lagrangian method is, where it comes from, how it relates to the more familiar Newtonian formulation, and how these beautiful laws of nature imply conserved quantities in everyday systems.</description>
