      <description>Part I: Providing the multifaceted story of how complex systems has evolved into what it is today is no easy feat. Dr. Melanie Mitchell not only gives a comprehensive historical tour of science and mathematics, she also provides foundational knowledge that any reader can carry to appreciate the essence of what it means for a system to be complex in the technical sense. Early on, she gives a clear definition of complex systems as an interdisciplinary field that studies how large networks of entities with no central controller can organize themselves and exhibit collective behavior given simple rules.</description>

      <title>Speed Walking in Chicago</title>

      <description>Chicagoans Always Speed My morning commute to work in the heart of downtown Chicago is very regular: Enjoy blazing hot coffee and listen to an interesting podcast all while super-speed-walking all the way to the office. I often think how much time I would save by teleporting to the office instead. Even while often walking faster than most on the busy morning sidewalks, there are folks that zoom past me but still appear to be walking gracefully.</description>

      <title>Introduction to Tensors</title>

      <description>Motivation:
 General Relativity Inertia Tensor Stress Tensor  It took me a whole week figure out what a tensor actually is. You will find many definitions and some are only partially correct. Let&amp;rsquo;s walk through the different explanations and learn how to think about them.
 (Array Definition) Tensor = Multi-dimensional array of numbers (scalars (rank 0), vectors (rank 1), matricies (rank 2), etc.). This is true in a sense but there is a truer geometrical meaning behind the concept of a tensor.</description>

      <description>Graphs may be represented in the form of a matrix. Main types of graphs that may be represented are:
 Simple Graph Multigraph Directed Graph Weighted Graph Bipartite Graph  Directed Graph Directed graphs are graphs that contain edges with direction. Vertices may have inward and outward edges.
Unlike adjacency matricies for simped graphs, adjacency matricies for directed graphs are non-symmetric. Elements of an adjacency matrix for a directed graph may be denoted as: $$A_{ij}$$ which represents an edge from vertex $j$ to $i$.</description>

      <description>Generalized Coordinates and Conservation Laws From the Lagrangian Formulation of Theoretical Mechanics These are selected notes from a group of topics I find of particular interest. Although I assume some previous knowledge of classical mechanics from you, I still provide a brief overview of what the Lagrangian method is, where it comes from, how it relates to the more familiar Newtonian formulation, and how these beautiful laws of nature imply conserved quantities in everyday systems.</description>
