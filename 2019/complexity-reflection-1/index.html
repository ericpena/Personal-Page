<p>Providing the multifaceted story of how complex systems has evolved into what it is today is no easy feat. Dr. Melanie Mitchell not only gives a comprehensive historical tour of science and mathematics, she also provides foundational knowledge that any reader can carry to appreciate the essence of what it means for a system to be complex in the technical sense. Early on, she gives a clear definition of complex systems as an interdisciplinary field that studies how large networks of entities with no central controller can organize themselves and exhibit collective behavior given simple rules. However, she also humbly confesses that given how nebulous the field is, there has yet to be one clear definition of complexity that everyone can agree on. I appreciate how candid she is about what is known and what is not known in this field. Mitchell shares that even a panel she organized of great system science thinkers at the Santa Fe Institute could not agree on an answer to the question: ``How do you define complexity?&ldquo;.</p>

<p>She acknowledges the potential skepticism that one might feel because of the nascence of this field. However, she encourages the reader by sharing fascinating real-world examples&mdash;such as ant colonies, brain activity, and internet networks&mdash;that show the ubiquity of complex systems and its necessity in understanding how systems evolve in our lives. She eloquently describes the emergent collective behavior that arises from these systems and the wide scale at which they occur. From thoughts and consciousness in the brain to global economic market movements, these can all be thought of as emergent phenomena attributed to complexity. She mentions that some have even call these systems superorganisms that exhibit a collective intelligence even in non-living, non-conscious systems. She borrows examples from economics stating that the self-interest of smaller economic entities such as companies and individuals create macroscopic effects that tend to not resemble the smaller systems at all. I appreciate that complex systems are not only accessible to all of us everywhere we are, but also require them to survive such as brain neuroactivity and heartbeat rhythms.</p>

<p>Given my background, the section on dynamics, chaos, and prediction resonated with me most. Mitchell beautifully tells the story of how the natural world was analyzed by great scientists in history and how our understanding of nature evolved. This historical account builds from Aristotle, Copernicus, Galileo, Kepler, and finally Isaac Newton and his revolutionary laws of motion. Newton established a concept of universality extending the natural laws from the terrestrial realm to celestial bodies&mdash;one of the most enlightening realizations in science.</p>

<p>When I consider physics paradigms in the context of complexity, I think about the dismantling of reductionism&mdash;where the notion that a system is the sum of its parts, as is the case in classical mechanics&mdash;is no longer valid. Mitchell does not talk much about reductionism directly but instead touches on a topic much richer on how concepts in physics directly led to the understanding of complexity and its causes. Much of physics is used primary to make predictions but Mitchell mentions two important scientific discoveries that make prediction very difficult: the uncertainty principle from quantum mechanics and the sensitivity of initial conditions from chaos theory. In 1927, Heisenberg taught us that the momentum and position of a particle cannot be known simultaneously but rather act as a trade-off of information. This is not an experimental limitation but an inherent limitation of information that is written into the law of physics. This must have been devastating during the time of Newton&rsquo;s ``clockwork universe&rdquo; when mathematicians such as Pierre Simon Laplace had ideas of being able to, in theory, predict everything at all times given we have the information to do so. The development of chaos theory by Poincar\&lsquo;e and Lorenz had a similar effect stating that even the tiniest variation in initial conditions can lead to drastically different outcomes&mdash;which served as another blow to predictability.</p>

<p>Mitchell sheds hope and motivates the reader by mentioning that in the same way there are universal laws in physics, there are similar invariants in the study of complex systems as well. Period-doubling as a system evolves to a chaotic state and the Feigenbaum&rsquo;s constant for the rate at which bifurcations converge are examples of remarkable invariant properties in complex systems. This provides an indication that the essence of physics can likely be applied to the field of complex systems and even possibly toward its version of a unified theory.</p>

<p>Dr. Melanie Mitchell seamlessly weaves together the concepts of information, entropy, energy, and thermodynamics. These are integral to the field so much so that she even refers to <code>entropy-defying self-organization&quot; as the</code>holy grail of complex systems&rdquo;. She resolves the misconception that entropy can at times decrease without consequence even though the law of thermodynamics forbids it. She talks about this in terms of Maxwell&rsquo;s Demon stating that work is required for the demon to do its job. I had learned about Maxwell&rsquo;s Demon in the past but had never considered this in terms of information. Szilard thought that work and energy was expended when obtaining the measurements of the particle&rsquo;s velocities&mdash;in other words, it requires work to obtain the relevant information needed. I find this to be a novel idea and a clever way to connect all of these concepts in one easy to understand example.</p>

<p>Another pivotal moment for me in reading Part I was in chapter 4&mdash;computation. In the same way that physics endured a disillusionment of endless predictability, mathematics and computability had a relatable event in history through the work of Kurt G\&ldquo;odel and Alan Turing.
David Hilbert&rsquo;s provocative questions for the mathematics community challenged the stability of mathematics itself. G\&ldquo;odel figured out how to convert statements into mathematical language and learned that there exists self-contradictory mathematical statements&mdash;showing that not everything in mathematics could be proven. Mathematics was viewed as being exacting and able to prove anything at that time. G\&ldquo;odel&rsquo;s Incompleteness Theorem shattered the apparent grandeur of mathematics and worried many practitioners. Alan Turing also came up with a similar answer using what was called a Turing Machine. The result had extended to machine language as well.</p>

<p>Dr. Mitchell is not only able to clearly explain a topic as abstruse as complex theory, she does so to a general audience without inundating the reader with technical jargon. Since there is not a definition of complexity that the scientific community can agree on, Mitchell offers some thoughts about possible ways that complexity could be defined. She is again very candid about the limitations of these definitions and explains why they would not hold up in isolation. All throughout Part I, she keeps the theme of being informative, honest, and motivating. She is honest about scientists not yet having a clear understanding of the field but also offers other examples in history where this was also true such as the concept of energy before it was well understood. Even today, research on genes and dark matter have yet to be understood fully but are making tremendous progress. I learned a great deal so far from this book and I look forward to the insight it has to offer in the remaining chapters.</p>

<p>Graphs may be represented in the form of a matrix. Main types of graphs that may be represented are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Simple Graph</li>
<li>Multigraph</li>
<li>Directed Graph</li>
<li>Weighted Graph</li>
<li>Bipartite Graph</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="directed-graph">Directed Graph</h3>

<p>Directed graphs are graphs that contain edges with direction. Vertices may have inward and outward edges.</p>

<p>Unlike adjacency matricies for simped graphs, adjacency matricies for directed graphs are non-symmetric. Elements of an adjacency matrix for a directed graph may be denoted as:
$$A_{ij}$$
which represents an edge from vertex $j$ to $i$.</p>

<p><figure><img src="/images/ring.svg" data-sizes="auto" data-src="/img_networks/DirectedGraph1.png" alt="Directed graph with four verticies" class="lazyload"><figcaption class="image-caption">Directed graph with four verticies</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>The corresponding adjacency matrix for the graph above is:
$$A = \begin{pmatrix}0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix}$$</p>

<h3 id="cocitation">Cocitation</h3>

<p>The cocitation of two vertices $i$ and $j$ in a directed network is the number of vertices that have outgoing edges pointing to both $i$ and $j$. We can see that:</p>

<div>$$A_{ik}A_{jk} = 1$$</div>

<p>if $i$ and $j$ are both cited by $k$. If we sum over all these elements we get the following relation:</p>
