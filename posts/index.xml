      <description>Providing the multifaceted story of how complex systems has evolved into what it is today is no easy feat. Dr. Melanie Mitchell not only gives a comprehensive historical tour of science and mathematics, she also provides foundational knowledge that any reader can carry to appreciate the essence of what it means for a system to be complex in the technical sense. Early on, she gives a clear definition of complex systems as an interdisciplinary field that studies how large networks of entities with no central controller can organize themselves and exhibit collective behavior given simple rules.</description>

      <title>Speed Walking in Chicago</title>

      <description>Chicagoans Always Speed My morning commute to work in the heart of downtown Chicago is very regular: Enjoy blazing hot coffee and listen to an interesting podcast all while super-speed-walking all the way to the office. I often think how much time I would save by teleporting to the office instead. Even while often walking faster than most on the busy morning sidewalks, there are folks that zoom past me but still appear to be walking gracefully.</description>

      <title>Introduction to Tensors</title>

      <description>Motivation:
 General Relativity Inertia Tensor Stress Tensor  It took me a whole week figure out what a tensor actually is. You will find many definitions and some are only partially correct. Let&amp;rsquo;s walk through the different explanations and learn how to think about them.
 (Array Definition) Tensor = Multi-dimensional array of numbers (scalars (rank 0), vectors (rank 1), matricies (rank 2), etc.). This is true in a sense but there is a truer geometrical meaning behind the concept of a tensor.</description>

      <description>Keeping Up With Complex Systems Science News It can be difficult to find time to keep up with interesting science, especially when articles are dense and abstruse. With an unfortunate name like complex systems, keeping up with the intersting news can be a daunting task. Here are a few resources that I use to keep up with the fascinating world of complex systems and systems engineering.

      <description>Nothing makes a website look polished like a clean, minimalistic favicon. This article quickly lists the steps to add a favicon to a Hugo website like this one.
 Create a favicon in an art package like Illustrator or Inkscape. Upload your image to Real Favicon Generator Extract the favicon package it creates to the /static/ directory which lives in the root of your HUGO site. Copy the given html and add it to your /layouts/partials/head.</description>

      <title>War | Coding a Card Game</title>

      <description>War Simulation in Python Game designer Greg Costikyan has observed that since there are no choices in the game, and all outcomes are random, it cannot be considered a game by some definitions. I chose to program this game because its complete random chance feature. It was an opportunity to practice python and writing recursive functions. The objective of the game is to win all cards. A 52-card deck is divided evenly among the players, giving each a down stack.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Truth is ever to be found in simplicity, and not in the multiplicity and confusion of things.&amp;rdquo;
Isaac Newton I approached R in the same way I would any language. I immediately delve into for-loops, conditional statements, user-defined functions, classes, and so on. I didn&amp;rsquo;t pay much attention to data types at first - assuming they&amp;rsquo;re not much different than what I&amp;rsquo;ve seen already. I found myself using dataframes and matricies often with low confidence and a lingering confusion.</description>

      <description>Graphs may be represented in the form of a matrix. Main types of graphs that may be represented are:
 Simple Graph Multigraph Directed Graph Weighted Graph Bipartite Graph  Directed Graph Directed graphs are graphs that contain edges with direction. Vertices may have inward and outward edges.
Unlike adjacency matricies for simped graphs, adjacency matricies for directed graphs are non-symmetric. Elements of an adjacency matrix for a directed graph may be denoted as: $$A_{ij}$$ which represents an edge from vertex $j$ to $i$.</description>

      <description>Generalized Coordinates and Conservation Laws From the Lagrangian Formulation of Theoretical Mechanics These are selected notes from a group of topics I find of particular interest. Although I assume some previous knowledge of classical mechanics from you, I still provide a brief overview of what the Lagrangian method is, where it comes from, how it relates to the more familiar Newtonian formulation, and how these beautiful laws of nature imply conserved quantities in everyday systems.</description>
