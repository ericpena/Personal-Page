      <description>War Simulation in Python Game designer Greg Costikyan has observed that since there are no choices in the game, and all outcomes are random, it cannot be considered a game by some definitions. I chose to program this game because its complete random chance feature. It was an opportunity to practice python and writing recursive functions. The objective of the game is to win all cards. A 52-card deck is divided evenly among the players, giving each a down stack.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Truth is ever to be found in simplicity, and not in the multiplicity and confusion of things.&amp;rdquo;
Isaac Newton I approached R in the same way I would any language. I immediately delve into for-loops, conditional statements, user-defined functions, classes, and so on. I didn&amp;rsquo;t pay much attention to data types at first - assuming they&amp;rsquo;re not much different than what I&amp;rsquo;ve seen already. I found myself using dataframes and matricies often with low confidence and a lingering confusion.</description>
