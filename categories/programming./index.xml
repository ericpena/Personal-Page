      <description>War Simulation in Python Game designer Greg Costikyan has observed that since there are no choices in the game, and all outcomes are random, it cannot be considered a game by some definitions. This is why I chose this as my Python practice problem. This was an attempt to brush up on Python but left me diving head-first into a recursion problem. This program simulates the card-game, &amp;ldquo;I Declare War&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Truth is ever to be found in simplicity, and not in the multiplicity and confusion of things.&amp;rdquo;
Isaac Newton I approached R in the same way I would any language. I immediately delve into for-loops, conditional statements, user-defined functions, classes, and so on. I didn&amp;rsquo;t pay much attention to data types at first - assuming they&amp;rsquo;re not much different than what I&amp;rsquo;ve seen already. I found myself using dataframes and matricies often with low confidence and a lingering confusion.</description>
